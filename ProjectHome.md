Following Google's Code planned shutdown I've migrated VL's repository to GitHub:

Visualization Library is a C++ middleware for high-performance 2D and 3D graphics applications based on the industry standard OpenGL 1.x-4.x, designed to develop portable applications for the Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems.

Visualization Library is currently used by professionals, researchers and students to develop 2D and 3D applications in fields such as scientific visualization, material sciences, geosciences, oil and gas exploration, health and medical training and visualization, civil and military simulation, virtual reality, augmented reality, visual simulation, plotting, data mining and visualization, presentations, multimedia applications, special effects, 2D and 3D games and so on.

Visualization Libray has been designed to be a fine-grained platform upon which a wide variety of highly-specialized 3D graphics applications can be effectively developed. Instead of abstracting the user from the underlying OpenGL API, Visualization Library stays as close as possible to it and defines a thin high-performance layer on top of it. The result is that many OpenGL functions and features have a 1 to 1 mapping to Visualization Library's classes.

You can think of Visualization Library as a toolkit that provides you with the power and flexibility of OpenGL within a light and user friendly C++ object oriented framework.
